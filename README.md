nme_download_file_example
=========================
This is a simple example of downloading a file in NME (Haxe)

It downloads a text file from an ASCII Art site, and saves it to a local file (Shared Object).

Since SharedObject is ported by NME to various platforms, this will save to a local file in Flash, Neko, and CPP targets.
